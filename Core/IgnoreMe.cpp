/**
 * It seems you've found the all important IgnoreMe.cpp file!
 *
 * Basically, CMake libraries NEED a .cpp file to determine the linker language, even if said file is empty.
 * So that's why this file exists. In an actual project, there would naturally be at least 1 .cpp file...
 * However, this is just a demonstration, so it doesn't :)
